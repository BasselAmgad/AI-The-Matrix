# AI-The-Matrix
This project's theme is based on the [Matrix franchise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_(franchise)).

![The Matrix: Agent Smith](https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Agent-Smith-replicated.jpg?)

Neoâ€™s mission is to end up at the telephone booth with all hostages that did not turn agents
returned (whether dead or alive) and, in the case hostages die and turn into
agents, each hostage that turned into an agent killed.

The aim of this project is to formulate a plan that Neo can follow to complete his mission.

The following search strategies are implemented and each is used to help Neo:
<ol type="a">
  <li>Breadth-first search.</li>
  <li>Depth-first search.</li>
  <li>Iterative deepening search.</li>
  <li>Uniform-cost search.</li>
  <li>Greedy search with two heuristics.</li>
  <li><strong>A<sup>*</sup></strong> search with two admissible heuristics.</li>
</ol>
